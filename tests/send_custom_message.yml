# Gets payload from /data/agora_chat.json

scenarios:
  - flow:
      - log: "Send custom message {{ $environment }}"
      - function: "getAgoraChatPayload"
      
      # Sends a post request to /sendCustomMessage and using function getAgoraChatPayload returned value "payload" as request payload
      - post:
          url: "/Message/sendCustomMessage"
          json: "{{ payload }}"
          
          # Captures the response.body.code value and save it as a variable named "code"
          capture:
            - json: "$.code"
              as: code
          
          # Assertions. response.statusCode is different from response.body.code based on API implementation
          expect:
          - statusCode: 200
          - equals:
            - "{{ code }}"
            - 200
